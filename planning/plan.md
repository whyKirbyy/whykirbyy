# Plan for this Site
## Looks
The website should be built like the inside of a computer, away from the video game feel. The bunny is still whykirbyy but it now should be like clipy. 
The spinning selection wheel is like an HDD thing.

The project showroom should be like a cpu or gpu

The email thing should be like a modem or networking stuff

In the HDD thing maybe could make it that peopke have to swap drives to get certain infos

## Features
Site has to remember who visited. So that dialog can be changed accordingly

Contact form where people can send ideas and that checks for the content.
Based on this makes counter what got pitched how many times.

## Concepts
bunny could be like cortana from halo.
